## For a long time, performance optimizations for websites focused primarily on the server side. So-called backend engineering was thought to be where serious engineering happened.

  <h3>Adding and managing caching layers between commonly requested resources</h3>
  <h3>Fine-tuning database queries and designing data structures to minimize bottlenecks</h3>
  <h3>Adding compute power and load balancing to increase capacity and protect performance under load</h3>
  <h3>Creating faster underlying network infrastructure to increase throughput within hosting platforms</h3>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  1. Each area is important. Good web performance requires a concerted
  effort at all levels of the stack, and a site will only be as performant
  as its least performant link in the chain. JAMstack removes tiers from
  that stack. It shortens that chain. Now operations on which teams used
  to spend large amounts of time and money to optimize in an effort to
  speed them up and make them more reliable donâ€™t exist at runtime at all.
  2. There is no code that can run faster than zero code. This kind of
  simplification and separation of the building of sites from the serving
  of sites yields impressive results.
