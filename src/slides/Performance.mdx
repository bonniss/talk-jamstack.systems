<Notes>
  [SKIP READING TITLE] For a long time, performance optimizations for
  websites focused primarily on the server side. So-called backend
  engineering was thought to be where serious engineering happened.
  [TOGGLE APPEAR] Each area is important. Good web performance requires
  a concerted effort at all levels of the stack, and a site will only
  be as performant as its least performant link in the chain. JAMstack
  removes tiers from that stack. It shortens that chain. Now operations
  on which teams used to spend large amounts of time and money to optimize
  in an effort to speed them up and make them more reliable don’t exist
  at runtime at all.
