import Layout from '../components/Layout'

ğŸ‘´In the early days of the web, a website was a simple folder with
HTML files exposed over HTTP. As the web evolved, we began moving 
to a model in which a running program on the server would build 
the HTML on the fly for each visit.

This was a much slower, more complex process than serving static
assets, but it was also the only viable way to work around the fact
that **browsers were simple document viewers ğŸ‘€** at the time. 

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    { children }
  </Layout>
)
