<Notes>
  [SKIP READING TITLE]. The freedom to do good workâ€”to design the exact
  experiences we want for our users is regularly compromised by complex
  monolithic applications. TheÂ architecturesÂ imposedÂ byÂ monolithic
  applications canÂ undermineÂ ourÂ abilityÂ to utilizeÂ theÂ latestÂ technologies
  andÂ evenÂ  affectÂ suchÂ thingsÂ asÂ ourÂ development workflows.
