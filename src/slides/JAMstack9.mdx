import Layout from '../components/Layout'

With the emergence of new practices, the real architectural constraints became the following:

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript in the browser as the runtime</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>Reusable HTTP APIs rather than app-specific databases</li>
    <li>Prebuilt markup as the delivery mechanism</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    { children }
  </Layout>
)
