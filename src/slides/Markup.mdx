  [SKIP READING TITLE]. In the early days of the web a website was
  a simple folder with HTML files exposed over HTTP. As the web
  evolved we began moving to a model in which a running program on
  the server would build the HTML on the fly for each visit. This
  was a much slower more complex process than serving static assets
  but it was also the only viable way to work around the fact that
  browsers were simple document viewers at the time. The JAMstack
  approach is to prebuild all the markup up front and serve it directly 
  to the browser from a CDN. This process typically involves a static
  site generator like Gatsby or Jekyll and a frontend build tool like
  Webpack where content and templates are combined into HTML source
  files are transpiled or compiled into JavaScript and CSS runs through
  preprocessors or postprocessors. This creates a strict decoupling
  between the frontend and any backend APIs. It allows us to remove a
  large set of moving parts from the infrastructure and make it much
  easier to consider the frontend and individual APIs involved in
  isolation.
