  1. In the early days of the web a website was a simple folder with
  HTML files exposed over HTTP. As the web evolved we began moving 
  to a model in which a running program on the server would build 
  the HTML on the fly for each visit. 2. This was a much slower
  more complex process than serving static assets but it was also
  the only viable way to work around the fact that browsers were
  simple document viewers at the time. 3. JAMstack approach 
  is to prebuild all the markup up front and serve it directly 
  to the browser from a CDN. 4. This process typically involves
  a static site generator like Gatsby or Jekyll and a frontend 
  build tool like Webpack where content and templates are combined
  into HTML source files are transpiled or compiled into 
  JavaScript and CSS runs through preprocessors or postprocessors.
  5.This creates a strict decoupling between the frontend and any 
  backend APIs. It allows us to remove a large set of moving parts
  from the infrastructure and make it much easier to consider 
  the frontend and individual APIs involved in isolation.
