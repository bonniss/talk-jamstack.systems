import Layout from '../components/Layout'

JavaScript has become a compilation target for transpilers, which translate 
variations of JavaScript into vanilla JavaScript runnable in all modern
browsers, and compilers for new or existing languages like Elm, 
ReasonML, ClojureScript, and TypeScript.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    { children }
  </Layout>
)
