# Modern web APIs were officially born with [Roy Fielding](https://twitter.com/fielding)’s dissertation, “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software Architectures,” in 2000.

### It defined Representational State Transfer (REST) as a scalable and discoverable architecture for services exposed through HTTP.

<Notes>
  1. The first web APIs were meant to be consumed from 
  server-side applications. 2. New standards like CORS,
  WebSocket, and PostMessage paired with OAuth2 and
  JSON Web Token for authorization and stateless 
  authentication, suddenly made any modern web API 
  reachable from any JavaScript client running in
  a browser. 3. All of the web has become something
  like a giant operating system. 4. We’re now seeing
  APIs exposed for anything from payments or
  subscriptions over advanced machine learning models
  running in massive cloud environments, to services
  that directly affect the physical world like shipping or
  ride-sharing services, and just about anything else
  you can imagine.
