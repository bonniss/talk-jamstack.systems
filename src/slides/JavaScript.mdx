      JavaScript is to the JAMstack what C was to Unix, as
      the browsers have become the operating system of the web.

<Notes>
  Since 1995 JS made a long way. Today's JavaScript includes advanced
  constructs for asynchronous actions, flexible classes and module
  system, elegant syntactic constructs, like destructuring assignment,
  and an object syntax that become the most commonly used data exchange
  format of the web and beyond (JSON). JS has become a compilation
  target for transpilers, which translate variations of JS into vanilla
  JavaScript runnable in all modern browsers, and compilers like Elm,
  ReasonML, ClojureScript, and TypeScript.
