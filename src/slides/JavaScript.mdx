# JavaScript prototype was born in May 1995 for a [10 day](https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/) spree by [Brendan Eich](https://brendaneich.com/).

    JavaScript is to the JAMstack what C was to Unix, as
    the browsers have become the operating system of the web.

<Notes>
  1. Since 1995 JS made a long way. Today's JavaScript
  includes advanced constructs for asynchronous actions,
  flexible classes and module system, elegant syntactic
  constructs like destructuring assignment, and an object
  syntax that become the most commonly used data exchange
  format of the web and beyond (JSON). 2. JS has become 
  a compilation target for transpilers, which translate 
  variations of JS into vanilla JS runnable in all modern
  browsers, and compilers for new or existing languages 
  like Elm, ReasonML, ClojureScript, and TypeScript.
