import Layout from '../components/Layout'

Teams end up over-provisioning their infrastructure to prevent
downtime or risk a crash because there is no clear separation
between the infrastructure required to generate and manage the site
and that required to serve the site.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    { children }
  </Layout>
)
