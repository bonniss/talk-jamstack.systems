# Consider a typical request life cycle on a relatively simple, but dynamic, site architecture

<LifeCycleRequest />

<Notes>
  1. A browser makes a request for a page.
  2. The request is handled by a web server that inspects the URL requested and routes the request to the correct piece of internal logic to determine how it should be satisfied.
  3. The web server passes the request to an application server that holds logic on which templates should be combined with data from various sources.
  4. The application server requests data from a database (and perhaps external systems) and renders this into a response.
  5. The response is passed back from the application server to the web server and then on to the browser where it can be displayed to the user.
  1. A browser makes a request for a page.
  2. A CDN matches that request to a ready-made response and returns that to the browser where it can be displayed to the user.
