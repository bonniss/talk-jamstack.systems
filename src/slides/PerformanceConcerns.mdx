# Monolithic apps need to generate and deliver HTML **every time** a new visitor arrives on the site 🐢

<Notes>
  1. It significantly slows down page load time.
  2. Caching is another part of overall site 
  performance that’s notoriously difficult to
  get right. It’s possible that the same URL
  can return different content depending on 
  a variety of parameters, including whether a
  user is logged in or the site was previously
  running a split test. 3. Performance isn’t
  dictated by speed alone. Because monolithic
  apps are so large, it can be difficult to
  define architectural boundaries. The code
  is so interconnected that fixing a 🐛,
  updating a library, or changing a framework
  in one part of the app can break another
  part of it.
