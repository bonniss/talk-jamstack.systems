<Notes>
  [SKIP READING TITLE]. Itâ€™s very difficult for the same person to be
  both an expert in client-side JS performance and server-side
  development, database query constraints, cache optimization, and
  infrastructure operations. When the backend and frontend were decoupled
  it made possible for devs to focus on just 1 area. You can run your
  frontend locally with an autorefreshing development server speaking
  directly to a production API, and switch between staging, production,
  or development APIs with setting an env variable. We can use 3rd party
  tools to outsource complexity. These providers have highly specialized
  teams focusing exclusively on their problem space. The more that we
  can prebuild, the more that we can deploy as prebaked markup with no
  need for dynamic code to run on our servers during a request cycle
  and the better off we will be. Executing 0 code will always be faster
  than executing some code. 0 code will always be more secure than 
  even the smallest amount of code. Assets that can be served without
  any moving parts will always be easier to scale than even the most
  highly optimized dynamic program.
