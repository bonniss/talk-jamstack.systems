# Serverless is a glue to deliver business value

<Split>
  <Serverless />
</Split>

<Notes>
  Microservice-based architecture and Serverless happened in tandem
  with the frontend and API layers splitting. 2. The concept of
  cloud functions was born, whereby simple functions doing just one
  thing can be exposed as microweb API endpoints. 3. At the same 
  time backend teams began moving away from one large monolithic API toward
  much smaller services with more narrowly defined responsibilities.
  4. Teams started adopting a serverless approach which
  utilizes managed services and allows providers to handle
  base functionality of the service and then use
  Cloud Functions to act like the glue between those services to
  deliver business value.
