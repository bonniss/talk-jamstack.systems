  # Serverless is a glue to deliver business value

  <Serverless />
</Split>

<Notes>
  [SKIP READING TITLE] Microservice-based architecture and Serverless
  happened in tandem with the frontend and API layers splitting. Backend
  teams began moving away from one large monolithic API toward much smaller
  services and started adopting a serverless approach which utilizes managed
  services and allows providers to handle base functionality of the service
  and then use Cloud Functions to act like the glue between those services to
  deliver business value.
