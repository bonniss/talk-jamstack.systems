import Layout from '../components/Layout'

This creates a strict decoupling between the frontend and any 
backend APIs.

It allows us to remove a large set of moving parts from the
infrastructure and live system, which makes it much easier to 
consider the frontend and individual APIs involved in isolation. 
The more we can **[bake, not fry](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404)**, 
the content layer of our site, the more simple deployments, scaling, 
and security become, and the better the performance and end-user 
experience will be.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    { children }
  </Layout>
)
