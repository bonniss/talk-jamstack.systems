## There are a variety of costs associated with designing, developing, and operating websites and applications, and they are undoubtedly influenced by the stack we choose.

<Notes>
  1. Capacity planning exercise is an important step for
  determining how much the site will cost to operate.
  It is difficult to estimate how much traffic a site
  will receive ahead of time so it is a common practice
  to overprovision servers. 2. With traditional 
  architectures the capacity has to extend
  through each tier often resulting in multiple servers
  for databases, application servers, caching servers,
  load balancers, message queues. 3. Web development
  projects also require multiple environments such as
  staging, testing and development, which requires a
  duplication of production infrustructure. 4. JAMstack
  sites benefit from a far simpler technical architecture.
  The burden of scaling a JAMstack site to satisfy 
  large peaks in traffic typically falls on CDN that is
  serving the site assets. 6. The JAMstack dramatically
  reduces the financial costs of building and maintaining
  websites and applications.
