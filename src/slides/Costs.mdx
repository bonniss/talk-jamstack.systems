  [SKIP READING TITLE] There are a variety of costs associated with
  designing, developing, and operating websites and applications, and
  they are undoubtedly influenced by the stack we choose. Capacity
  planning exercise is an important step for determining how much the
  site will cost to operate. It is difficult to estimate how much
  traffic a site will receive ahead of time so it is a common practice
  to overprovision servers. With traditional architectures the capacity
  has to extend through each tier often resulting in multiple servers
  for databases, application servers, caching servers, load balancers,
  and message queues. Web development projects also require multiple
  environments such as staging, testing and development, which requires
  a duplication of production infrustructure. JAMstack sites benefit
  from a far simpler technical architecture. The burden of scaling a
  JAMstack site to satisfy large peaks in traffic typically falls on
  CDN that is serving the site assets. The JAMstack dramatically
  reduces the financial costs of building and maintaining websites and
  applications.
