# Web sites have traditionally been powered by ~~[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)~~ monolithic architectures

<Notes>
  <p>
    In monolithic architectures the frontend of the 
    application is tightly coupled to the backend.
    Monolithic applications are opinionated about how 
    tasks on the server take place. The opinions they
    enforce have shaped how web development is approached.
