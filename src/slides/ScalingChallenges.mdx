# Infrastructure needs to be scaled in anticipation of site traffic.

      Not only is that expensive, it’s also difficult to get right 💸

<Notes>
  1. Because monolithic architecture requires the page view
  to be generated for every visitor, infrastructure needs
  to be scaled in anticipation of site traffic. 2. Teams end
  up over-provisioning their infrastructure to prevent
  downtime or risk a crash because there is no clear separation
  between the infrastructure required to generate and manage the site
  and that required to serve the site.
