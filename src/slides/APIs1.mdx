Modern web APIs were officially born with
[Roy Fielding](https://twitter.com/fielding)’s dissertation,
“Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software Architectures,”
in 2000.

It defined Representational State Transfer (REST) as a scalable and
discoverable architecture for services exposed through HTTP.
