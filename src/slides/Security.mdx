<h2>
  A minimal surface area with largely read-only hosting infrastructure
</h2>

<Appear>
  <h2>
    Decoupled services exposed to the build environment and not the public
  </h2>
  <h2>
    An ecosystem of independently operated and secured external services
  </h2>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  Fewer pieces of infrastructure means fewer things to 
  attack and fewer things on which you need to spend 
  effort patching and protecting. Reducing surface area
  is a good strategy toward improving security and 
  minimizing avenues for attack.
