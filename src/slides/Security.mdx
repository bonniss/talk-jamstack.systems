    A minimal surface area with largely read-only hosting infrastructure

  <h2>
    Decoupled services exposed to the build environment and not the public

<Notes>
  When considering security, the term surface area is often used to
  describe the amount of code, of infrastructure, and the scale of the
  logical architecture at play in a system. Fewer pieces of 
  infrastructure means fewer things to attack and fewer things on which you
  need to spend effort patching and protecting. Reducing surface area
  is a good strategy toward improving security and minimizing avenues for attack.
