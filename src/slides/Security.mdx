<Notes>
  When considering security, the term surface area is often used to
  describe the amount of code, of infrastructure, and the scale of the
  logical architecture at play in a system. Fewer pieces of 
  infrastructure means fewer things to attack and fewer things on which
  you need to spend effort patching and protecting. Reducing surface area
  is a good strategy toward improving security and minimizing avenues for attack.
