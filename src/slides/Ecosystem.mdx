<Notes>
Let's have a look at this image.
For every JAMstack project you'll have to choose a couple of things:
1. JS framework (React, Vue, Svetle, Preact, Angular, etc)
2. Static site generators. You should choose it depending on your tastes.
You can go with Gatsby if you prefer JS, or you can choose Hugo with GO
as it's templating language or you can even choose Jekyll with Liquid if
you are feeling brave. And also consider project requirments, because
all SSG are different. E.g. if you are concerned with build time you might
look into HUGO. Smashing magazine reported that it's 7500 page website
is getting generated in 13 seconds. 3. CMS. You can choose between a headless
CMS (Senity, Contentful) which is a back-end only content management system
that makes content accessible via a RESTful API. Or you can choose a git
centric CMS such as Netlify CMS. It stores content in your Git repository
alongside with the code for easier versioning and you can handle updates
directly in Git. 4. Deployment provider (zeit, netlify, google firebase).
Your deployemnt provider will take care of:
* running automated builds of your site using your favorite build tools
* generating a full preview site for every push
* preserving every historical version of your site
