# According to recent estimates, Wordpress powers 29% of the web. Joomla and Drupal follow as the second and third most popular content management systems, respectively. That makes them a prime target for bad actors.

<Notes>
  Monolithic apps like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla combine every
  single component and plug-in of a web project’s architecture into a
  single codebase. In turn, it creates a massive surface area for 
  malware to penetrate. Not only is the attack surface area extremely
  large, it’s also exposed every single time the site is built because any
  plug-in the site uses must execute each time the page loads for a new
  site visitor, magnifying the risk.
