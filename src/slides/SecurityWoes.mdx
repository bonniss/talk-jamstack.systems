  According to recent estimates, Wordpress powers 29% of the web. Joomla
  and Drupal follow as the second and third most popular content management
  systems, respectively. That makes them a prime target for bad actors.

<Notes>
  Monolithic apps combine every single component and plug-in of a web
  project’s architecture into a single codebase. In turn, it creates a
  massive surface area for malware to penetrate. Not only is the attack
  surface area extremely large, it’s also exposed every single time the
  site is built because any plug-in the site uses must execute each
  time the page loads for a new site visitor, magnifying the risk.
